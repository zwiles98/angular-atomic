# CARBON ANGULAR STARTER

Kick start your application development with Carbon Angular.

## Prerequisites

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (`brew install npm`)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/) (`brew install git`)
* [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) (`sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## Download and install

Run the following in the terminal:

```bash
# to download
git clone https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-angular-starter.git

# to install
cd carbon-angular-starter
npm install
```

## Development server
Run `npm run start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## How to use components

Look at the [component library](https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/) and [developer documentation](https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/documentation/).

## Create new angular components

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## PWA ready

Carbon Angular Starter was built with offline and progressive web app in mind.

It provides [`manifest.json`](src/manifest.json) and service worker ([`sw.js`](src/sw.js)).

For daily development purposes, this may get in the way of your workflow, so if you're not actively working on customizing your service worker, we suggest disabling cache/offline data/service worker in your browser. Just remember to re-enable it when you're doing tests on it.
